All UI work must follow the [Design System Spec](./design_spec.md). That file defines the rounds, shadows, palette, typography, spacing, and iconography rules—plus concrete CSS snippets—needed for consistency. Always review it before adding or adjusting screens so every card, button, and avatar continues to use the 10px radius, centered-down hard shadow, and the gradient/typography palette called out there.
